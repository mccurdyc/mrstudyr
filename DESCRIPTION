Package: mrstudyr
Title: A tool for retrospectively studying mutant reduction techniques for mutation testing
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Colton", "McCurdy", email = "mccurdyc@allegheny.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: In an attempt to decrease runtime of the mutation analysis process we will
    attempt to generate a subset of data that can effectively and accurately (a
    mutation score in close proxmity to the mutation score of the original dataset)
    provide mutation scores. The selective approach will select a set of mutants
    that will accurately represent the entire dataset.
