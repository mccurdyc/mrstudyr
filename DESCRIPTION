    mutation testing

Description: In an attempt to decrease runtime of the mutation analysis process
    we will attempt to generate a subset of data that can effectively and accurately
    (a mutation score in close proxmity to the mutation score of the original
    dataset) provide mutation scores. The selective approach will select a set of
    mutants that will accurately represent the entire dataset.
