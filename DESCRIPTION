Description: In an attempt to decrease runtime of the mutation analysis process we will
    attempt to generate a subset of data that can effectively and accurately (a
    mutation score in close proxmity to the mutation score of the original dataset)
    provide mutation scores. The selective approach will select a set of mutants
    that will accurately represent the entire dataset.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.2.3)
